# Why Would I Need Japanese Fonts Rotated 90 Degrees Counter-Clockwise?
Imagine you are reading a Japanese ebook in an app called KOreader.

You want to read vertically rather than horizontally, but--ARRRGHGHGH! KOreader does not support vertical text! Arrghghg, the pain!

So you create a CSS user style to set the text direction to vertical--AND IT DOESN'T WORK! Uorghghgagh!

So then, you download the vertical fonts from this repo and apply them in KOReader. You tilt your device 90 degrees, and ahhhh. Bliss. And perfect vertical text...

# ‚ùóNotice
- I do not own these fonts. I simply rotated them for personal use.
- These rotated fonts vary in quality. Most were generated using this [excellent script by the userMyK00L](https://github.com/MyK00L/tategakifont) and are very accurate. Some were manually tweaked in FontForge. And of course, I will take pull requests from anyone who has a font to add. So, expect inconsistency between fonts.
